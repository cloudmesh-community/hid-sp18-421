\section{Apache Avro}

Avro \cite{hid-sp18-421-AvroCloud} is a framework for data serialization,
modelling and also to make Remote Procedure Calls. Avro defines different
schemas for serialization and deserialization whenever it reads or writes the
data, It also handles modified data. Avro defines more compact data encoding and
faster data processing.The data format which Avro defines supports variety of
programming languages. Avro ensures data compression at nodes in Apache Hadoop.
With in Hadoop can pass data from one program to another. Avro uses JSON as a
schema. Avro differs from similar systems like Thrift, Protocol Buffers by
schema evaluation, untagged data and dynamic typing.
